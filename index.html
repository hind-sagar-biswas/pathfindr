        <p>BFS stands for Breadth-First Search, and it is a way to explore a graph or a maze in a systematic way. Imagine you are
        in a maze and you want to find the exit. You start at the entrance of the maze, and you want to explore it in a way that
        you don't miss any paths and you find the shortest path to the exit.
        <br>
        To use BFS, you start at the entrance of the maze and explore all the paths that are connected to it, such as the
        corridors or rooms that are directly adjacent to it. Then, you explore all the paths that are connected to those paths,
        and so on, until you find the exit.
        
        To do this systematically, you use a queue, which is like a line of people waiting for something. In this case, you use
        the queue to keep track of the paths you need to explore. You start by adding the entrance to the queue, and then you
        explore the paths that are directly connected to it. For each of these paths, you add them to the end of the queue.
        
        Then, you take the first path in the queue and explore the paths that are directly connected to it. For each of these
        paths, you add them to the end of the queue. You keep doing this until you find the exit.
        
        BFS guarantees that you will find the shortest path to the exit, because you explore all the paths that are the same
        distance away from the entrance before you explore any paths that are farther away. So if there is a shorter path to the
        exit, you will find it before you find a longer path.</p>

        <h2>DFS algorithm <span class="less-imp">(explained such that even middle schooler understands)</span>:</h2>
        <p>DFS stands for Depth-First Search, and it is a way to explore a graph or a maze in a systematic way. Imagine you are in
        a maze and you want to find the exit. You start at the entrance of the maze, and you want to explore it in a way that
        you don't miss any paths.
        <br>
        To use DFS, you start at the entrance of the maze and explore one path as far as you can before backtracking and
        exploring another path. For example, you might choose to follow the first corridor you come across until you reach a
        dead end, and then backtrack to the last intersection and try a different path.
        
        To do this systematically, you use a stack, which is like a stack of pancakes. In this case, you use the stack to keep
        track of the paths you need to explore. You start by adding the entrance to the stack, and then you explore the first
        path on the stack as far as you can. For each new path you come across, you add it to the top of the stack.
        
        When you reach a dead end, you remove the top path from the stack and go back to the previous intersection to explore a
        different path. You keep doing this until you find the exit.
        
        DFS does not guarantee that you will find the shortest path to the exit, because you might explore a long path before
        exploring a shorter path. But it is still a useful algorithm for exploring mazes and other graphs.</p>
